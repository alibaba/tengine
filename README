Introduction
------------
Tengine is a web server originated by Taobao, the largest e-commerce website in Asia. It is based on Nginx HTTP server and has many advanced features. Tengine has been proven very stable and efficient on the top 100 global websites, including taobao.com and tmall.com.

Tengine has been an open source project since December 2011. It is being actively developed by the Tengine team, whose core members are from Taobao, Sogou and other Internet companies. Tengine is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to get involved.


Features

* All features of nginx-1.2.7 are inherited, i.e. it is 100% compatible with nginx.
* Dynamic module loading support. You don't need to recompile Tengine when adding new modules to it.

* Logging enhancement. Syslog (local and remote), pipe logging and log sampling are supported.
* A mechanism to support standalone processes.
* Protecting server in case system load or memory use goes too high.
* Multiple CSS or JavaScript requests can be combined into one request to reduce downloading time.
* Proactive health checks of upstream servers can be performed.

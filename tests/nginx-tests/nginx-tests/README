Test suite for nginx.

Use prove to run tests as one usually do for perl tests.  Individual tests
may be run as well.

Note: tests run nginx (and backend daemons if needed) listening on localhost
and may use various ports in 8000 .. 8999 range.

Usage:

    $ TEST_NGINX_BINARY=/path/to/nginx prove .

By default tests expect nginx binary to be at ../nginx/objs/nginx.

Environment variables:

TEST_NGINX_BINARY

    Sets path to nginx binary to be tested, defaults to "../nginx/objs/nginx".

TEST_NGINX_VERBOSE

    Be a bit more verbose (in particular, print requests sent and responses
    got from nginx).  Note that this requires prove -v (or HARNESS_VERBOSE).

TEST_NGINX_LEAVE

    If set temporary directory with configs and logs won't be deleted on test
    completion.  Usefull for debugging.

TEST_NGINX_CATLOG

    Cat error log to stdout after test completion.  Usefull for debugging.

TEST_NGINX_UNSAFE

    Run unsafe tests.

Happy testing!

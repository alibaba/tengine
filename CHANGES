    *) Change: the "421 Misdirected Request" response now used when
       rejecting requests to a virtual server different from one negotiated
       during an SSL handshake; this improves interoperability with some
       HTTP/2 clients when using client certificates.

    *) Change: HTTP/2 clients can now start sending request body
       immediately; the "http2_body_preread_size" directive controls size of
       the buffer used before nginx will start reading client request body.

    *) Bugfix: cached error responses were not updated when using the
       "proxy_cache_bypass" directive.

    *) Change: non-idempotent requests (POST, LOCK, PATCH) are no longer
       passed to the next server by default if a request has been sent to a

       appear in logs when using the "sendfile" and "aio" directives with
       subrequests.

    *) Bugfix: "zero size buf in output" alerts might appear in logs if
       caching was used and a client closed a connection prematurely.

    *) Bugfix: connections with clients might be closed needlessly if
       caching was used.
       Thanks to Justin Li.

    *) Bugfix: nginx might hog CPU if the "sendfile" directive was used on
       Linux or Solaris and a file being sent was changed during sending.

    *) Bugfix: connections might hang when using the "sendfile" and "aio
       threads" directives.

    *) Security: invalid pointer dereference might occur during DNS server
       response processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an
       attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to
       cause segmentation fault in a worker process (CVE-2016-0742).

    *) Security: use-after-free condition might occur during CNAME response
       processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker
       who is able to trigger name resolution to cause segmentation fault in
       a worker process, or might have potential other impact
       (CVE-2016-0746).

    *) Security: CNAME resolution was insufficiently limited if the
       "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker who is able to
       trigger arbitrary name resolution to cause excessive resource
       consumption in worker processes (CVE-2016-0747).

    *) Feature: the "auto" parameter of the "worker_cpu_affinity" directive.

    *) Bugfix: the "proxy_protocol" parameter of the "listen" directive did
       not work with IPv6 listen sockets.

    *) Bugfix: connections to upstream servers might be cached incorrectly
       when using the "keepalive" directive.
